# GMVAE

This is repository with implementation of GMVAE following [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02648). It's used to tackle 
embedding of gene expression data and is accompanied by [blog post](https://wesenheit.github.io/bayes/2023/03/19/GMVAE-clustering-applied-to-RNA-sequencing.html).
To reproduce the results uv manager is recommended. To measure clustering properties kBET R library is needed.

There is also nice usage of GMVAE to clustering of MNIST dataset which is more user friendly for those who want to skip biological inclinations of problem.
